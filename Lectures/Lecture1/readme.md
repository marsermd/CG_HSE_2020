## Assignment №1: _"Broken Shader"_
Michael was in such a hurry to get to the lecture, that he messed up both [vertex](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Shader) and the [fragment](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Fragment_Shader) shader!
Instead of a beautiful and well-lit sphere, he got a strange stripy figure.

Since he is your teacher, he asked you to repeat his mistakes, claiming that "it is supposed to look like that". You can find his broken build [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wSG1u3oygeQU3NagQRrphPzivOrMqOnP).
1) Use [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org) to peek into the messy shaders he made. 
2) Change Assets/Scripts/BrokenShader.shader in such way, that the sphere in Assets/HomeWork/BrokenSphere.unity looks exactly the same as Michael's. (Open the project with [Unity 2019.2](https://unity.com/ru/releases/2019-2))
3) Make sure that you have a perfect representation of Michael's results.
4) Send me a screenshot of your results at <mischapanin@gmail.com> along with your shader. 
5) e-mail should have the following topic: __HSE.CG.<your_name>.<your_last_name>.HW1__

Hint: you can attach RenderDoc to unity AND to the broken build to see the difference between the shaders.
